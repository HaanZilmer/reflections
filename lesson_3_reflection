when you are working on a group project with multile computers so that many people can see the changes made.
there might be things in the github repository that you think are wrong therefore you would no want them to transfer onto your computer.
a fork "steals" someone's repository, a clone copies their repository, a branch is a deviation of of your own repository. 
having a copy allows me to make multiple changes and not mess with someone else's changes and then merge the two.
collaboration without github would make it so that i have to be in the same room with my partner which would make working together much harder, but we would understand each other's thinking better.
